# DQN Attempts at Keezen

This repository contains a lot of files that were used to try DQN (and others) at Keezen. The scripts and classes have been changed in many ways, but still failed to achieve acceptable results. The current status of the files does not per se reflect the most logical configurations.   

The `/rlcard_keezen_dqn/examples/` directory contains a lot of scripts. The ones that start with `keezen` were used to train agents. `keezen_dqn.py` was used the most with a lot of variyng configurations.  

The `/rlcard_keezen_dqn/experiments` directory contains a set of results of experiments. Some with an end result in the form of a chart (fig.png), some without a result because of a crash or a cancelation. The generated models are not in this repository. They were quite big (50-90MB) and did not perform well.
